# Challenge4

This weeks Challenge was to create a JavaScript code quiz. 

The challenge was to create a quiz that starts with the click of a button. 

Once that button is clicked a timer begins counting down and a question is presented. When the question is answered an alert informs if the answer was correct or not. When you answer incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock. 

Once all of the questions have been answered, or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. 

Once the game is over your score is displayed. Your score is equal to how fast you complete the quiz. 

You are then prompted to input your initial and given a chance to explore the "HighScores" page where your scores will be saved and displayed. 

Here is a few screenshots of the quiz.
